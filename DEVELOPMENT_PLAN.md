# 🎯 Lab17 Agents Marketplace Development Plan
--------------
## 🔥 IMMEDIATE PRIORITY - Database Setup
**CRITICAL:** Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor first:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.agents ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS icon text DEFAULT 'Bot';
ALTER TABLE public.agents ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS webhook_url text;
ALTER TABLE public.agents ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS keywords text[] DEFAULT '{}';
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_agents_keywords ON public.agents USING GIN (keywords);
```
This is done by the user
---------------------
