## Why TheVault

* **Battle‑tested:** Every agent passes Lab17’s QA harness, real‑world pilots, and stress scenarios before it ships.
* **Production‑grade:** Observable, versioned, rollback‑ready; optional human‑in‑the‑loop on sensitive steps.
* **Faster outcomes:** Deploy in hours, not weeks. Start with GTM; expand to Support, Finance, Ops, and more.
* **Secure by design:** Runs on your infra or Lab17‑managed. Data stays in your workspace.
* **Your stack, your rules:** Integrates with Google Ads, Meta, TikTok, YouTube Ads, HubSpot, Airtable, Shopify, Gmail, Google Sheets, Slack, WhatsApp, Calendars, and more.

> **Theme:** Production‑grade. Validated. Tested. Built to move revenue and reduce operational drag.

## Who it’s for

* **SMBs:** Scale output without scaling headcount. Close more, waste less.
* **Freelancers / Individuals:** Research, proposals, follow‑up—executed like clockwork.
* **Agencies & Teams:** White‑label templates, shared libraries, and client‑specific builds.

## Start with Go‑To‑Market (GTM) Acceleration

**Featured agents (examples):**

* **Inbox Ninja** – Unified lead capture → enrichment → instant routing.
* **Missed‑Call Voice AI** – Auto‑call back, qualify, schedule, log to CRM.
* **Ad Spend Optimizer** – Daily budget & bid suggestions; push‑button apply.
* **CRM Hygiene Bot** – Dedupes, tags, updates stages, and closes loops.
* **Proposal Prep** – Drafts proposals from discovery notes; routes for e‑sign.
* **Meeting Memory** – Recordings → summaries → action items → owners & due dates.

> Then extend to **Support** (deflection, triage), **Finance/Ops** (invoicing, reconciliations), **Recruiting** (sourcing, screening), and beyond.

## What makes it “battle‑tested”

* **Acceptance benchmarks:** Clear SLAs for accuracy, latency, and reliability per agent.
* **Real‑world pilots:** Each template validated on real data and edge cases.
* **Observability pack:** Logging, metrics, and alerts—ship with guardrails, not guesswork.
* **Approvals & failsafes:** Human review gates for high‑impact actions; safe rollbacks.
* **Versioning:** Track changes, compare outcomes, and revert instantly.

---

## How it works

1. **Pick a template** → connect tools and targets.
2. **Tune guardrails** → fields, thresholds, approvals.
3. **Go live** → observe, iterate, and scale.

Or **Request Custom** → we spec, build, and deliver a private agent visible only to your workspace.

## Outcomes to target (examples)

* 90% faster lead response & routing.
* 10–20% reduction in paid media waste via daily bid/budget hygiene.
* 30% uplift in recovered missed calls → meetings booked.
* Hours saved weekly on CRM hygiene and proposal prep.

*Targets vary by stack and baseline; we set metrics upfront and track in‑product.*
